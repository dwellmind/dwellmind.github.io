My name is Pierre Le Gall, some friends of mine call me Pieru.

I'm a music lover, especially of Techno/Trance culture. I like sleeping, boardgames and bananas too. I just hate when things are unnecessarily complicated.

I currently work at Zenika Nantes as developer. I use to work with the JS/Node.js stack for my clients, however I'm more inspired by the Erlang/Elixir ecosystem at the moment. More globally, I'm interested in “lowtech” solutions.

You can find me on the Internet on Twitter, Github, or on this website where you can found some blog posts.
